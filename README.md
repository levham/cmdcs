`CmdCs` is an advanced command-line tool that enhances the capabilities of the standard Windows command line (CMD) with C#-like syntax and can translate these commands into executable Batch (`.bat`) files. This project can function both as an interactive shell and directly convert C#-like code blocks, including loop and variable logic, into `.bat` scripts.
